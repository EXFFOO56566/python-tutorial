'''
Difference between List and Tuple
1	Lists are mutable	           
    Tuple are immutable
2	Implication of iterations is Time-consuming	      
    Implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3	The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.	
    Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
4	Lists consume more memory	           
    Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list
5	Lists have several built-in methods	    
    Tuple does no have must built-in methods.
6	The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur	
    In tuple, it is hard to take place.
